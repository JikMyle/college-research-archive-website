# NwSSU Research Paper and Capstone Repository

This website was intended as a major course output in Software Engineering.
The site's purpose is to act as a digital substitute to physical archiving.
Physical archiving has its own set of risks that are remedied by some aspects of
a digital environment such as degradation of material and tedious manual searching.

This website was created with the use of Laravel which greatly helped in the
development process and security of the website.

The site was active from March 29, 2024 to April 12, 2024.
