                Your exclusive destination within the College of Computing and
                Information Sciences department, where we empower students to
                store, safeguard, and access their research papers and capstone
                documents online. Say goodbye to the hassles of physical storage
                and experience the convenience of a secure and easily accessible
                academic archive tailored to your needs. Join us in the digital
                revolution of research management and excellence! <br>

                The proposed system is to implement a repository which helps store
                and manage research papers and capstones in the Northwest Samar
                State University College of Computing and Information Sciences.
                The proposed system is an effective solution to the limitations
                found in physical archiving. <br>
                <br>
                The proposed system stores and manages digitized copies of
                research papers and capstones in NwSSU-CCIS. Researching previous
                successful papers and capstones could be made more convenient for
                regular users. Management of the documents could be easier for
                administrators and the college faculty. <br>
                <br>
                This study is significant as it solves problems commonly found in
                physical archiving. Digital archiving requires minimal physical
                facilities compared to its counterpart, only needing a secure
                server and electronic devices to access it. The proposed system
                reduces the need for a dedicated archive room and the risk of
                damage to the documents. It also removes the inconvenience of when
                the employees responsible for handling access to the archive room
                are unavailable. The hassle of managing shelves full of documents
                is also lessened by allowing administrators to effectively manage
                the repository from any device with an internet connection. <br>
                <br>
                It also makes it more convenient for students and other authorized
                individuals to browse research papers and capstones in the
                college. Documents stored in the repository can be filtered to
                easily locate papers from a specific program or have certain
                subjects. Only administrators are capable of managing the system,
                thus reducing the risk of users tampering with the contents of the
                repository. <br>
